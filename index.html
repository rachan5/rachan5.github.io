    <p> If I don't start blogging now, then I never will. 
    Work is getting better, I'm feeling less lost and there's more structure to my work. 
    Thank you K.Yew for the "mentorship", but your style is not compatible with me. 
    I don't want to turn into a , quoting my manager, "jack of all trades and master of none".
    Look forward to getting stuff done tomorrow.
    </p>

    <h1>05/01/16</h1>
    <p> Start of 30 day blog, I'm already a day behind.
    Spent the morning tending to the front yard with my mom and grandma.
    We chopped down an annoying shrub and repotted some of the other foliage.
    Wandered around the backyard and played with the good ol' chickens.
    Great way to destress!
    Drove to the gym to read some Murikami, then bought some milk and yogurt.
    Slept around 11pm, an hour later than usual.
    </p>

    <h1>05/02/16</h1>
    <p> Boss is out the next two days! Hoorah!
    Spent some quality time writing some Robot Framework automation code.
    Finished about half of what I aimed to finish this sprint, but that's ok.
    Plan to submit my letter of resignation after Memorial Day.
    No one's going to see that coming.
    It's going to be an awkward two weeks after that ...
    K.Yew, why you gotta ASSUME so hard???
    I am not fully convinced I want to switch to your team.
    Why do you think I am?
    My concerns have not been addressed and your examples are real shyte sometimes.
    I hope to leave work aroud 4pm tomorrow.
    Going to finish that chapter of Murikami and hit the hay a little after 10pm.

    Missed the morning question,
    So here's the evening questions: 
    What good have I done this day?
    What are 3 remarkable things that happened today?
    How could I have made today better?
    
    Today I presented a Transfer of Information on behalf of my development team.
    But more importantly, I replied to concerns Girls Who Code club members,
    I'm glad that they are still interested in the club, even though they haven't been showing up recently.
    I think I was fair with what they need to complete in order to graduate. 
    Still waiting on an acknowledgment from one of them.

    First remarkable thing that happened: my team completed sprint planning in about two hours. Usually it takes like 6 hours to complete. Atambe drove most of the effort, but it carried it through the bare essence of scrum/agile. I don't think I would have done that much better. But I definately would have lead more by example, like for the restrospective portion. I have a hunch that when I come back from vacation that the team will be in a shit storm.

    Second remarkable thing that happened: there were no questions after presetning the TOI on behalf of my development team. This, like the first point, saved lots of time. It meeting had one hour allocated for it, but we only used about 0 minutes plus approximately 10 minutes for it. That was great, it enabled me to leave work around 3:30pm with a clear conscience.

    Third remarkable thing that happened: Bleach and One Piece came out early this week. That was a pleasant surprise. Though Tite Kubo gave a shitty chapter. The previous chaptes were alright, so I was expecting something of the same calibur. One Piece always has interested plot development. Though I started reading it mid way through the series, it's quite intriguing.

    I could have made today better by smiling a bit more and spread some positivity amongst my coworkers. There's a lot of criticism among the team, and I don' think its always intentional. English not being most of my coworker's first language contributes to that issue. I feel there are significant amount of misunderstandings and misinterpretations of verbal and non-verbal messages. It's kinda of hard to mitigate that because lots of dialouge occurs and I don't know when chime in. I noticed however, that when I do talk, I turn a hanful of heads, so that's nice. Today could have been better by using more of the following sentence structures "I like that you ....", "I appreciate ....", ".... good job.....", "thank you for ....", "I'm hearing/understand that (insert my interpreation), is that correct?" and others. Responding to Mai's (pronouced MAY's) email would have also made today better.

    The morning questions:
    What good shall I do this day?
    What would make today great?
    What I am grateful for ... an old relationship, an oppurtunity I have Today, something great that happened yesterday, and something simple near you.

    Going to facilitate some cs learning today at SI and make people feel good about what they've learned.
    Today would be great if we leave dinner feeling good about each other and our work relationships.
    I am grateful for the having Aluice as a friend for last couple of years. His frank and real perspectives on matters keeps my thoughts humble.
    I am grateful today for the oppurtunity to be a part of a school. It's coming to an end though, but it had a large influence on my career choices.
    I am grateful for being able to come home early without much traffic on the commute home. 
    I am grateful having job and food to eat.

    The evening questions:
    What good have I done today?
    What are 3 remarkable things that happened today?
    What could have made today better?
    
    Today I got to share a lot of laughter and relieve some stress with my friends and SI acquaintances.
    1. A great conversation with the club student representative on how to improve the club for the next year.
    Keywords/Notes: Supplement, more structure, What's the point of coming if I can do it at home? Break down projects over a couple weeks.
    Throw attendance out the window and just do. Due diligence for prep. Listen/Ask for feedback and reflect.
    2. Found parking really close to the Thai Time :) 
    3. Got home before 10pm, have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.
    Having more engaging interactions with Vu would have made today better. 
    Conversing with more people about how to improve the club would have been nice also.

    It would be great if I could finish a draft of the NetApp guide before 4pm, so I can forward it to my coworkers to review.
    I am grateful that Wind reached out to me, we haven't spoken in a really long time. even though the exchange was short, it was refreshing.

    Yon Corp company outing, spending quality time with the CEO.
    Today would be great I get home with little traffic. Finishing that NetApp draft would also be nice.
    I am very grateful for having a great CEO journey with me through life. I'd seriously drop whatever I'm doing and work for that man.
    I am grateful for the oppurtunity today to given attention from the upper management.
    I am grateful for being a part of a cool devops team.
    I am grateful that there is lactose free milk to drink in the morning.
