<b> Distribution list  </b>

<p>

<ol>
<li> <b>9/26</b>  
<ul> 
<li> Introduction and logistics
<p> 

<li> <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/unix.html">
Norman Matloff's toturial page</a>: Read, at least, 
  <ol> 
  <li> `if you have no Unix background at all' 
  <li> `The Unix file system' 
  <li> `Extremely quick and simple introduction to the Vi Text editor'
  </ol> 
<p> 

<li> Work your way through <a href="http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davis/30/Unix%20Workshop.htm">Sean Davis' ECS30 Unix tutorial</a>   
and <a href="http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davis/30/vi%20Tutorial.htm">vi tutorial</a> 
<p> 

<li> Everyone who is enrolled should have a computer account set up for 
using computers in the CS Instructional facility (CSIF) in the basement 
of Kemper Hall. Go to the CSIF lab to look up your user name. Your 
initial password is the last 8 digits of your student ID. 
If you want to change your password, and you should want to, read 
the man file for the Unix command yppasswd (type man yppasswd), 
to learn more about the command. Help is available in room 47 for 
using the labs. Note that this help is for using the labs, not 
help with CS 30. 
<p> 

<li> You may also log into the CSIF machines remotely 
(see
<a href="http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davis/30/UC%20Davis%20Computer%20Science%20at%20Home.htm">UCDAVIS Computer Science at Home</a>). 
Or you can work on any other machine that has Unix, and a C compiler 
for writing C programs, and internet access. 
<p> 

<li> Note: Different systems 
(operating systems, computer type, configurations, libraries etc.) 
can behave differently, so a C program written on one machine and system 
might not behave exactly the same on a different machine or system 
(an ugly reality!). You may find it more convenient to do most of your 
work at home, or in another lab, BUT before handing in your program, 
you must make sure it works correctly on the machines in the CSIF. 
Those are the machines we will use when we compile, run and grade 
your programs. If your programs don't run correctly there, it will 
not matter to the grader that they ran correctly elsewhere. It is 
your responsibility to port your programs in time to the CSIF and 
test them there. It will not be a legitimate excuse that the connection 
to the CSIF was down just before the assignment was due. Also, 
we (Instructors and the TAs) can only give very limited help on problems 
you encounter on machines and systems outside of the CSIF, and how to 
set up the software to work at home, or connect to the CSIF remotely. 
Campus IT staff and the CSIF staff can also help somewhat on those 
issues if you run into problems. 
<p> 

<li> Unless stated otherwise, all assignments are meant to be done 
individually. Of course you can discuss some aspects of the assignment 
with others, but each student is expected to individually work out assignments. 
If you have any questions about the degree of individuality that 
is expected, please ask. We may routinely run all the submitted homework 
programs through a utility that finds pairs of programs that 
are ``too similar". We really don't like dealing with such a situation, 
so please design and write your programs yourself. Also, you will 
learn much more that way, and be better prepared for exams. 
<p> 

<li> Discussion sections in the first week of 9/29-10/3 will be
held in the CSIF Computer Lab (room 67).  After the first week, all the 
discussion sections will be held in their scheduled classrooms. 
<p> 

<li> 
Learning C requires learning a great number of exacting details 
and you will not get your C programs working unless you learn 
those details. However, in the long run, what is of value is learning 
how to <I><b>think</b></I> like a programmer, how to 
<I><b>organize</b></I> your thoughts in a way that can be 
<I><b>translated</b></I> into a computer program, 
and how to <I><b>debug and verify</b></I> the correctness of your program. 
Those skills will be emphasized in this class - to large extent, you will 
teach yourselves the details of C, and I will teach you how to think 
like a programmer.

Learn the basics of the gdb debugger and debugging. At a minimum learn how to list, execute one line at a time, set and unset breakpoints, print variable values. The use of a debugger is often essential. gdb is available on most unix based systems. ddd is a GUI based on gdb. Use it if you have it.
