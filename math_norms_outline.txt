Mathmatical Norms
    -> How is math presented to the students?
    -> What math roles are they expected to play?
    -> How are the Standards for Math Practice addresed?

~~~ Journaling ~~~

Consider the following:
-> The teachers' questions, instructions, and feedback to students
-> Oppurtunities provided for communication, collaboration, etc.
-> Messages teacher give about brain science, mindset or other messages that might impact how students perceive themselves
-> The math tasks, and oppurtunities provided for representation, problem-solving, making connections, etc
-> The role of competition and praise
(-> Norms may be explicit or implicit)
(-> Attend to norms we are _trying_ to establish)
(-> Attend to norms that become established without meaning them to)


*1st 3 weeks* specific to this classroom
    Take notes on the math culture being established:
    -> What are students learning about what doing math is all about?
    -> What does it mean to be "good at math"?
    -> What math norms are valued? How are they established?
    -> What math practices are encouraged? How?
    -> What role do students play? How does the teawcher communicate students' roles? Are there different roles for different students?
    -> What role does the teacher play?
    -> What role does the tewcher play in establishing the norms? What does the cirriculum play?


Analysis Assignment:
1. Summarize
    Answer the above questions.
    Include details:
        - What did you or CT _say_ or _do_ to try and establish a particular norm. Evidence that norms are in fact established?

2. Anticipate
    - Discuss norms you would like to establish in your classroom.
    - How will you go about establishing them>
    - What will be the same/different from what you see in your placement? Explain.


Jo's Classroom Norms (http://www.youcubed.org/wp-content/uploads/Positive-Classroom-Norms2.pdf)
1. Evereyone can learn math to the highest level
    - Encourage students to believe in themselves
    - Growth mindset:
        ~ Believing that they can learn anything
        ~ The more work they do the smarter they will get
        ~ Praise what students have done and learned
            e.g. "It is great that you have learned that."

2. Mistakes are valuable
    - "I love mistakes and they will be valued at all times"
    - "It's good to make mistakes because it makes our brain grow."
    - Ask students with mistakes (esp deep/conceptual ones) to present them on the board.
    - Instead of being discouraging or sympathetic,
        Say "Your brain just grew! Synapses are firing, ,that's really good."
    - Ask students to read positive brian/mistake messages
        e.g. "Easy is a waste of time" or "Working hard grows your brian"
3. Questions are really important
    - Always ask questions, always answer questions.
    - Ask yourself: "Why does that make sense?"
4. Math is about creativity and making sense
    - Math is a creative subject that is, at its core, about visualizing patterns and creating solution paths that other can _see_, _discuss_, and _critique_ them. 
5. Math is about connections and communicating
    - Math is a connected subject and a form of communication.
    - Represent math in different forms (words, picture, graph, equation)
    - Link them!
    - Color code!
6. Math class is about Learning, not Performing
    - Top mathematicians think slowly and deeply.
7. Depth is more important than speed
    - Math is a growth subject, it takes time to learn and it is all about effort.
